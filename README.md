# Rust Learning

This repo contains small Rust lessons, each with:
- an `example` binary (complete reference)
- an `exercise` binary (starter stubs with `TODO`s)
- an integration test file for validation

## File layout
- `src/bin/c01_example.rs` ... `src/bin/c30_example.rs`
- `src/bin/c01_exercise.rs` ... `src/bin/c30_exercise.rs`
- `tests/c01_tests.rs` ... `tests/c30_tests.rs`

## Lesson flow (~15 minutes each)
1. Read and run the example.
2. Open the matching exercise file.
3. Fill in `TODO` sections to match behavior.
4. Run the matching test file until green.

## Commands
Run a lesson example:
```bash
cargo run --bin c05_example
```

Run a lesson exercise:
```bash
cargo run --bin c05_exercise
```

Run validation for one lesson:
```bash
cargo test --test c05_tests
```

Run all lesson tests:
```bash
cargo test --tests
```

## Study Plan

Work through one lesson at a time. Read the example, then complete the exercise. Don't move on until the exercise compiles and runs correctly.

### Beyond Chapter 30
The lessons above cover the core language in depth. Once you finish them, good next topics are:
- Async / `tokio` — concurrent and asynchronous programming
- `RefCell<T>` and interior mutability
- Custom iterators (`impl Iterator`)
- Procedural macros and `derive` macros
- Building a small CLI or web service to apply everything
